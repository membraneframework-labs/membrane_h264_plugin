defmodule Membrane.H264.Parser.AUSplitter do
  @moduledoc """
  Module providing functionalities to divide the binary
  h264 stream into access units.

  The access unit splitter's behaviour is based on 7.4.1.2.3
  "Order of NAL units and coded pictures and association to access units"
  of the "ITU-T Rec. H.264 (01/2012)" specification. The most crucial part
  of the access unit splitter is the mechanism to detect new primary coded video picture.
  WARNING: Our implementation of that mechanism is based on:
  7.4.1.2.4 "Detection of the first VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture"
  of the "ITU-T Rec. H.264 (01/2012)", however it adds one more
  additional condition which, when satisfied, says that the given
  VCL NALu is a new primary coded picture. That condition is whether the picture
  is a keyframe or not.

  This function splits the given list of NAL units into the access units.

  It can be used when the access unit splitter is used for the stream
  which is not completly available at the time of function invoction,
  because apart from the list of access units the functions returns it's state,
  to be used in next invocation.
  When the whole stream is available at the invocation time, the use can use
  `split_binary_into_access_units/1`.
  Under the hood, `split_nalus/5` defines a finite state machine
  with two states: :first and :second. The state :first describes the state before
  reaching the primary coded picture NALu of a given access unit. The state :second
  describes the state after processing the primary coded picture NALu of a given
  access unit.
