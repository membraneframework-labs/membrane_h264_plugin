  @moduledoc """
  A module defining a struct representing a single NAL unit.
  """

  @typedoc """
  A type defining the structure of a single NAL unit produced
  by the `Membrane.H264.Parser.NALuParser`.

  In the structure there ardqde following fields:
  * `parsed_fields` - the map with keys being the NALu field names and the values being the value fetched from the NALu binary.
  They correspond to the NALu schemes defined in the section *7.3.* of the *"ITU-T Rec. H.264 (01/2012)"*.
  * `stripped_prefix` - prefix that used to split the NAL units in the bytestream and was stripped from the payload.
  The prefix is defined as in: *"Annex B"* of the *"ISO/IEC 14496-10"* or in "ISO/IEC 14496-15".
  * `type` - an atom representing the type of the NALu. Atom's name is based on the
  *"Table 7-1 â€“ NAL unit type codes, syntax element categories, and NAL unit type classes"* of the *"ITU-T Rec. H.264 (01/2012)"*.
  * `payload` - the binary, which parsing resulted in that structure being produced stripped of it's prefix
  * `status` - `:valid`, if the parsing was successfull, `:error` otherwise
